### Day 2: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python in codeacademy and ended at Unit 2.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed getting the concepts but I don't really understand when and why I would apply them. Perhaps this is why it is suggested that we work on projects as we learn.  Definitely need to put together a schedule to know what I'm heading towards.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Went to FreeCodeCamp meetup in Dallas. Downloaded Visual Studio Code and put together a practice page using hmtl and css. 

**Thoughts** Was super nervous but learned that I don't have to remember everything. Looking things up is my friend and practice is where confidence is born.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Spend some time on sizing images through freecodecamp.

### Day 5: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out how to find the index file on the firstProject VScode text editor. Watched videos and everything to no avail. 

**Thoughts** Found it on my desktop in a folder named "Projects". I might order a udemy course for some extra guidance.

### Day 7: January 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Code Academy elements module.

**Thoughts** This module helped me understand some of the things I was asked to do early on in the freecodecamp sequences. It's all coming together (i hope). I'll do a project this weekend to test what I've learned so far.
